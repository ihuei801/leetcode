# Graph
# Eulerian path: a trail in a finite graph which visits every edge exactly once => 
# zero or two vertices have an odd degree 
# If there are exactly two vertices of odd degree, all Eulerian trails start at one of them and end at the othe
# Eulerian cycle: an Eulerian path which starts and ends on the same vertex. => no vertices of odd degree

# Time Complexity: O(ElogE) (create edge) + O(E) (dfs visit each edge once) + O(E) reverse
