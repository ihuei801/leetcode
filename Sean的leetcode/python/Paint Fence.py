# DP
# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(1)
# State:
# Same[i]: number of ways if the last two have same color
# Diff[i]: number of ways if the last two have diff colors
# Function:
# Same[i] = Diff[i]
# Diff[i] = (Same[i-1] + Diff[i-1]) * (k-1)
# Initialization:
# Same[2] = k
# Diff[2] = k * (k-1)
# Answer: Same[n] + Diff[n]
